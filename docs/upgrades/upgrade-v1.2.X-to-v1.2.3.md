## Upgrading ALZ Modules
  
  Due to a current bug, the SLZ is only compatible with ALZ PowerShell module version 4.1.5. This will be addressed in a future release. If you have previously installed the ALZ PowerShell module which is not ALZ Version 4.1.5, Please run following command.

  ``` Uninstall-Module -Name ALZ -AllVersions -Force ```
